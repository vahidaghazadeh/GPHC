**GPHC** (pronounced "githlth") is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool written in Go that audits local Git repositories against established Open Source best practices. It evaluates documentation quality, commit history standards, and repository hygiene, providing a comprehensive Health Score with actionable feedback.

## Features

### Documentation & Project Structure
- **Essential Files Check**: Validates presence of README.md, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- **Setup Instructions**: Ensures clear installation and usage instructions
- **Gitignore Validation**: Checks for proper .gitignore configuration with common patterns

### Commit History Quality
- **Conventional Commits**: Validates adherence to conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, etc.)
- **Message Length**: Ensures commit messages stay within 72-character limit
- **Commit Size Analysis**: Identifies oversized commits that might indicate "God Commits"

### Git Cleanup & Hygiene
- **Local Branch Cleanup**: Identifies merged branches that should be deleted
- **Stale Branch Detection**: Finds branches with no activity for 60+ days
- **Branch Protection**: Checks for main branch protection (requires GitHub API)
- **Stash Management**: Analyzes Git stash entries and warns about old stashes (>30 days)

### Historical Health Tracking
- **Health History**: Automatically saves health scores to `.gphc-history.json`
- **Trend Analysis**: Shows project health improvement over time
- **CI Integration**: Track quality metrics in continuous integration
- **Team Insights**: Monitor team progress and code quality trends

```yaml
# Commit analysis settings
max_commits_to_analyze: 50

# Branch analysis settings
stale_branch_threshold_days: 60

# Commit message settings
max_commit_message_length: 72

# Commit size settings
max_commit_size_lines: 500

# Scoring weights (1-10)
weights:
  documentation: 3
  commits: 4
  hygiene: 2
```

## Architecture

GPHC follows a modular architecture with discrete checkers reporting to a central scoring engine:

```
Input: gphc check [path]
    â†“
Data Collector: go-git repository analysis
    â†“
Checker Modules: Independent Go structs implementing Checker interface
    â†“
Scoring Engine: Aggregates results with weighted scoring
    â†“
Reporter: Colorful terminal output with structured results
```

### Core Components

- **`internal/git/`**: Repository data collection and analysis
- **`internal/checkers/`**: Individual health check implementations
- **`internal/scorer/`**: Scoring engine and health report generation
- **`internal/reporter/`**: Terminal output formatting
- **`pkg/types/`**: Core data structures and interfaces
- **`pkg/config/`**: Configuration management

## Development

GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o gphc.exe cmd/gphc/main.go
```

### Adding New Checkers

1. Implement the `Checker` interface in `internal/checkers/`
2. Add your checker to the main checker list in `cmd/gphc/main.go`
3. Define appropriate scoring weights in the configuration

### Example Checker Implementation
```go
type MyChecker struct {
    BaseChecker
}

func NewMyChecker() *MyChecker {
    return &MyChecker{
        BaseChecker: NewBaseChecker("My Checker", "MY", types.CategoryDocs, 5),
    }
}

func (mc *MyChecker) Check(data *types.RepositoryData) *types.CheckResult {
    // Implementation here
}
```
